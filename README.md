# All stackables to 200

- Made by Asgavin

SQL script to change all stackables to 200 or more.
Things like ammo that can stack to 1000 aren't changed only stuff that stacks to under 200

Use `All_Stackables_200_Up.sql` in **acore_world** to apply the changes. 
If you'd like to revert them, use `All_Stackables_200_Down.sql` in **acore_world**.
